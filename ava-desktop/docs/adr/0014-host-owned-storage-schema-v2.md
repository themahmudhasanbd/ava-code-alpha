# ADR 0014: Adopt host-owned storage schema v2

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-26

## Context

The original desktop persistence model split durable state across a limited
SQLite schema and Electron-owned JSON files. Session messages stored a lossy
text projection, project identity was represented as a singleton workspace,
scheduled tasks bypassed the Rust host, and several product surfaces had no
durable model for turns, artifacts, task runs, model metadata, or indexed
search.

Those boundaries conflict with the frozen host-ownership rule in ADR 0011 and
make protocol-visible behavior depend on which process last wrote a local
file. Expanding the old tables in place would also leave ambiguous ownership
and inconsistent migration behavior.

## Decision

Adopt schema v2 in the single host-owned `pi.sqlite` database.

The Rust host is the exclusive writer for:

- namespaced key/value configuration;
- projects and project-scoped sessions;
- canonical transcript blocks and turn lifecycle data;
- model catalog metadata;
- artifacts;
- scheduled tasks and task-run history;
- indexed, prunable audit events.

Electron accesses this state only through the host RPC protocol. Scheduled
task JSON is imported into the host database and is no longer authoritative.

Migrations are ordered Rust functions keyed by `PRAGMA user_version`. The
v1-to-v2 migration creates a one-shot backup before rebuilding incompatible
tables, preserves recoverable user data, and completes transactionally.
Session/project imports and legacy scheduled-task imports are idempotent.

## Consequences

- Durable state has one ownership boundary and one migration mechanism.
- Transcript blocks, turns, usage, artifacts, project grouping, task history,
  and search can evolve without renderer-owned persistence.
- A migration failure is surfaced instead of silently opening a partially
  upgraded database.
- The backup consumes additional disk space until the user removes it.
- Protocol, storage, migration, and E2E specifications must move together with
  future structural changes.
- Schema v2 replaces the storage implementation described before D086 while
  retaining ADR 0011's Rust-host ownership boundary.

## Alternatives

### Extend the v1 tables without rebuilding

Rejected because the v1 message shape is lossy and the split ownership model
would remain.

### Keep scheduled tasks in Electron JSON

Rejected because it violates the host-owned persistence boundary and prevents
atomic task/run lifecycle updates.

### Let the renderer write SQLite directly

Rejected because concurrent writers would couple UI lifecycle to data
integrity and bypass host RPC validation.
