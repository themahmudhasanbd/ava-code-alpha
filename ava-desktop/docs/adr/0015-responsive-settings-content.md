# ADR 0015: Make settings content responsive to window width

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-26

## Context

D070 established a 720px settings content band from a 1200px-wide Codex gold
capture, and D090 retained those visual metrics while simplifying the settings
directory. That fixed cap leaves increasingly large unused space on wider
windows even though the full-page settings shell and right pane already resize
with the native window.

The setting cards need to use the actual desktop window size while preserving
the fixed navigation rail, readable pane gutters, and the existing compact
shell.

## Decision

The settings content inner container fills 100% of the width available in the
right pane after the 275px rail and pane gutters. CSS flex layout owns resizing;
the renderer does not add window listeners, viewport calculations, or
JavaScript layout state.

This supersedes only D070's 720px content-band cap and the portion of D090 that
retained that cap. All other D070 and D090 navigation, chrome, spacing, card,
theme, and interaction decisions remain unchanged.

## Consequences

- Settings cards expand and contract immediately as the native window resizes.
- Wide windows no longer reserve an arbitrary empty area to the right of the
  content.
- The minimum supported window width continues to preserve the fixed rail and
  existing pane gutters without horizontal page scrolling.
- Settings specs and E2E coverage must verify narrow, default, and wide window
  sizes.

## Alternatives

### Keep the 720px maximum

Rejected because it ignores the available native window width and wastes space
on larger displays.

### Calculate width in React

Rejected because the existing flex layout already exposes the correct
available pane width, while JavaScript window listeners add unnecessary state
and synchronization work.

### Use a viewport-width formula

Rejected because manually subtracting the rail and gutters duplicates CSS
layout knowledge and can drift into overflow.
